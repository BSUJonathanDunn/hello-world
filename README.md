# hello-world
This repository is here to practice branching and the general Github Flow. Also the start of my future portfolio as I continue my Computer Science career!

Hello, my name is Jonathan Dunn. I'm a computer science student at Boise State University and hope to enter the digital security field one day.

Currently, I'm a supervisor for part of our custodial crew at the university. It's not a glamorous job, but it pays the bills and I get a pretty sweet discount on tuition and credit costs.

My hobbies include video gaming, programming, drawing, and learning new things! Hope to work with you one day!
